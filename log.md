- andrew:
    - some general questions?
    - fit means for the locality; mind as emergent; 
    - co-regulation -- using other brain to organize its own process
    - how does this different from other forms of recognition -- e.g. friendship  
    - Porges -- social approach vs ... 
    - neurodiversity -- discourse; is it pathology?
    - implications for citizenship; for responsibility; 
    - social bond trumps other things; 
    - larry ray on violence
    - relation to classical sociology: habitus; 
    
- cmr has a list of oppositions to work with:
    - health illness
    - human animal
    - same different
    - self other
    - mind body
    - child adult
    - self as plural verb (Segal)
    - questions: how does trauma work? How does violence work? How do people respond to violence (bomb, rape)? How is change possible? How can we help others? 

- For me:
    - relation to affect theory;
    - relation to body theory;
    - what happens to psychoanalytic account;
    - what is the relation to the science?
        - science studies treatment of this; 
    - neuropolitics, somatic citizenship?
        - rose on critical friends; see YouTube lecture
        - disease sociology (Montoya!); Michael Marmot; 
    - affect on ethics and understanding? 
    - implications for media, publics, 
    - methods for neuro
        - learning to re-regulate heart variability; retrain the body; do some singing 
    - relation to utopias

- todo:
    - look at larry ray article
    - start with a dance;
    - ask them to sit comfortably ...
